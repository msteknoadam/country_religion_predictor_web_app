# Country Religion Predictor Web App

This branch is made to let people use the country religion predictor model without installing anything to their computer. The predictions are made on the server so all load is taken away from user to the server. You can see the actual model which is created in Python at [this](https://github.com/msteknoadam/country_religion_predictor) repository.
